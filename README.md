Inspired by PollEverywhere, Omnipolls is a full stack polling web application which uses Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, Redux, and PostgreSQL database.

Presenters can poll audiences and receive real-time live results. Audiences can respond to polls through the website itself, or through SMS messaging.

## Features

OmniPolls consist of many features designed with user friendliness and interactivity in mind.

### Groups

Groups act as organizational containers that the user can use to store related questions.

### Graph Rendering & Live Results

The presenter can receive live visual results through implementation of WebSockets.

### Active Polling & Responses

Presenters have the ability to set which poll is active to the audience in real time. If a poll is not active, the audience cannot respond.
